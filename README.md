# Fast-Shoot

Fast Shoot is a simple multiplayer fps made with the open source framework [UMI3D](https://github.com/UMI3D/UMI3D-SDK).
Thanks to this framework, players enter the game with a VR headset or a desktop.
The objective was to make a minimalist FPS just to be sure to be able to finish a project in few weeks without spending too much time on it.
